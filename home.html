					<p>Hi I'm Colin, a programmer, tech enthusiast and a student!</p>
					<p>I am an Applied Computing undergraduate studying in Scotland and I love to mess around with code. I am currently building this website in my spare time and hosting it on my Raspberry Pi.</p>
					<p>Check out some other stuff I've been working on!</p>

					<h2>Personal Website</h2>
					<p>HTML, CSS, Javascript (jQuery) and Bootstrap<br>Ongoing project</p>
					<p>I started making this website for a few reasons. First off, I am tinkering with my Raspberry Pi and looked at hosting a website on my local network as a hobby project. I decided that I probably needed a portfolio website for others to check out what stuff I'm doing, but more importantly so I can keep track of what I'm doing and how I am presenting that info to other people. I was so impressed with the results that I looked into getting this site publicly available - but hosted on the Pi on an Apache 2 web server.</p>
					<p>I learned a fair bit about how my home network works by working on this project. My home internet comes in to my modem which simply forwards all traffic to my third party wireless router. After forwarding port 80 (standard HTTP port) on my modem to my router and port 80 on my router to my Pi running on a static IP, I tried to view the website externally by typing my public IP address in to a browser. A strange quirk of the way home networks operate that I discovered was that I would always be redirected to my modem's dashboard from within the network instead of being forwarded to my Pi. I thought I messed up my port forwarding which is why I was seeing the dashboard and not being redirected to my Pi.</p>
					<p>For a few days I couldn't find why I wasn't seeing this site, eventually I tried accessing the site from outside the network - and the page loaded instantly! As it turns out, routers/modems will often assume you want to configure them if you try to access the external address from within the network - even if you've set them up to forward that traffic elsewhere.<br></p>
					<p>Overall it was nice to 'beat' the awful design of internal network routing (or lack thereof) and I've had a great time messing around with my Pi which I now have set up so I can SSH into it over the internet and update the site remotely with a simple git pull. It also turns out that I'm saving about Â£40 a year by self-hosting comparing hosting subscription costs to the cost of running a Pi 24/7 with a domain name for a year, which isn't the point of me self-hosting but it's definitely a nice bonus!</p>
